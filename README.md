# TheBigBang_project
Since I've just finished to watch _The Big Bang Theory_ sitcom, I found quite funny to strengthen my acquiring skills in Python and Data Analysis 
to build a small project in which I extract data from the [Wikipedia page of the sitcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Big_Bang_Theory_episodes) 
and then make some basic analysis.

## Step 1: extracting data from the web.
In the *bbp_data_extraction* file, you can find how I implemented the scraping of the tabular data for all 12 seasons.

## Step 2: make some EDA (work in progress...)
